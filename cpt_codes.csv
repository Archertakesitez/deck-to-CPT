33502,The provider ties off a coronary artery arising irregularly from the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery cannot handle the higher pressure associated with blood flowing from a coronary artery; this procedure prevents congestive heart failure and corrects failure to thrive that results from such an anomaly in an infant.
33503,The provider ligates the coronary artery that arises irregularly from the pulmonary artery and places a graft to restore circulation to the heart.

He performs the procedure to restore circulation to the heart and prevent or correct congestive heart failure, typically in infants with congenital heart defects."
33507,"The provider relocates the opening or origin of an anomalous coronary artery arising from within the wall of the aorta. This rare condition, often diagnosed secondary to workup for something else, can result in sudden cardiac death. The provider removes a portion of the artery wall and reconnects the aorta and coronary artery in a more anatomical position.

33600,The provider patches or sutures an incompetent valve to restore appropriate blood flow between the chambers of the heart.
33602,"When the aortic or pulmonary semilunar valves fail to close completely, resulting in a leaky valve, the provider repairs the leak using sutures or a patch. A leaky valve allows blood to flow backward into the heart, reducing heart function and causing the ventricle to pump harder. The ventricle enlarges, causing further loss of function."
33606,"The provider joins the pulmonary artery to the aorta to correct a congenital deformity called double inlet ventricle in which the patient has only one functional ventricle, the left, which both the aorta and the pulmonary artery enter.

33612,"The provider places an intraventricular tunnel graft from the aorta to the ventricular septal defect (VSD), to reroute blood flow. When the tunnel graft obstructs blood flow through the ventricular outflow tract, he repairs the outflow tract with a patch graft."
33615,"The provider closes an atrial septal defect, or hole in the wall between the atria, with a patch graft. He then anastomoses, or connects, the pulmonary artery to either the atria or vena cava to correct tricuspid atresia, or congenital absence of the opening between the right atrium and the right ventricle."

33665,"An atrioventricular (AV) canal defect is repaired by closing the hole in the cardiac septa that causes mixing of blood inside the heart chambers. Valve competence also needs to be restored.

This relieves blockage of blood flow through the outflow tract."
33677,"The provider closes several ventricular septal defects with sutures or patch grafts to prevent the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the ventricles.

77300,"Radiation therapy is one of the most effective treatment methods for cancerous tumors. Due to its negative side effects like damage to the healthy cells, radiation therapy involves thorough planning of the dosage, the method, and the duration of the treatment. Dosimetry refers to the calculation of radiation dose (the amount and duration of radiation energy) that a patient needs for the successful treatment of the malignancy. The dose is measured in units of ""grays"" (Gy) and the number of Gy units a patient needs depends upon the type and stage of cancer being treated. Some of the factors that need calculation and planning for radiotherapy include the central axis depth dose, nominal standard dose (NSD), time dose factor (TDF), gap calculation, off axis factor, tissue inhomogeneity factor, and non–ionizing radiation surface and depth dose. Based on the outcome of the treatment, the physician can modify the dosage through subsequent dosimetries."

This reduces the risk of exposure for the healthy tissues that might come in the way of the beam as the intensity and angle of each beam can be adjusted with the help of the computerized delivery system.

78812,"PET scans are highly effective in the detection of cancerous cells in the body. A PET scan provides a three–dimensional image of the body that makes it easy to detect the presence of a malignant tumor. Cancer cells have a higher metabolic rate than normal body cells and a PET scan takes advantage of this while imaging. The patient is injected with a radiopharmaceutical tracer called FDG (fluoro–deoxyglucose, a radioactive substance containing glucose) one hour prior to the scheduled imaging. The radiotracer spreads throughout the body through the blood stream and gets absorbed by cells and starts emitting small amounts of energy (positrons). The positrons collide with electrons resulting in the production of photons that travel in opposite directions. The photon emission is captured by the PET scanner and processed with a computer to produce a three–dimensional image of the body tissues. Cancerous cells show a high radiotracer uptake and are highly visible in the scan in comparison to healthy cells."

78815,"PET and CT scans are both standard imaging tools that allow doctors to evaluate the location and metabolic actions of tumors or cancer inside the body before beginning an active treatment regimen. When alone, each imaging study has their own benefits and limitations but as the results of these two scans are ""fused"" together, the combined image provides a more complete picture and information on tumor location and metabolism."
78816,"The patient is injected with a radiopharmaceutical tracer called FDG (fluoro–deoxyglucose, a radioactive substance containing glucose) about one hour before the imaging is scheduled to begin. The radiotracer spreads in the body via the blood stream and gets absorbed by cells and starts emitting small amounts of energy (positrons). The positrons collide with electrons resulting in the production of photons that travel in opposite directions. The photon emission is captured by the PET scanner and is processed in a computer to give a three–dimensional image of the body tissues being studied. Cancerous cells display a high radiotracer uptake and are highly visible in the scan in comparison to healthy cells. But the PET scan has a limitation in terms of pinpointing the location of a tumor. This shortcoming is overcome by the combination of a PET and CT. The CT scan produces thin cross–sectional slices of internal organs.
