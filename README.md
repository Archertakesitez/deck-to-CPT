## Abstract ðŸŽ„
This project is a web application that helps match healthcare-related PDF documents (such as pitch decks or medical documentation) with appropriate CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes. Users can upload PDF documents through a web interface and choose between two analysis methods: a keyword-based matching system using TF-IDF, or an AI-powered analysis using GPT-4. The application processes the uploaded documents, removes sensitive information (like emails, phone numbers, and personal names), and returns the top 5 most relevant CPT codes with their descriptions. This tool is particularly useful for healthcare startups and medical professionals who need to quickly identify appropriate medical billing codes based on service descriptions.
